# Smart Room

In this project a smart room with sensors and actuators is designed. The sensors detect the environmental conditions and actuatores excecute actions based on the output of the AI planner. 
The system not only controls the temperature and lightning system, but also attempts to gain "free heating" by opening and closing the windows.
